## Project Overview

This project involves developing a PHP and MySQL web application by extracting a zip file into the XAMPP htdocs folder. The main task is to construct and test a SQL query in phpMyAdmin to fetch specific data from "customers" and "addresses" tables, utilizing INNER JOIN and grouping. Once the query is confirmed, it is integrated into index.php to generate a webpage displaying customer information. The entire project is version-controlled using Git and submitted via a GitHub repository URL.
